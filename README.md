This project is to aggregate issues in any open source projects that still use obsolete and deprecated SHA1 algorithm.

Depending on usecases one should upgrade to any modern alternatives.

* For cryptographic hash function capability upgrade to [SHA2-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Comparison_of_SHA_functions)
* For key derivation function use [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)
* For password hashing use [Yescrypt](https://www.openwall.com/yescrypt/)
